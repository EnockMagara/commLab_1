CAMPUS STORY VIDEO ASSETS
=========================

Add your video files here:

1. campus-story.mp4 - Your main 90-second video
2. campus-story.webm - Alternative format for better browser support  
3. video-poster.jpg - A poster/thumbnail image for the video

The website will work even without these files, but you'll see placeholders until you add your actual content.

For best results, ensure your video is:
- Exactly 90 seconds long
- 1920x1080 resolution (16:9 aspect ratio)
- High quality audio (the story focuses on sound!)
- Optimized for web playback

You can delete this file once you've added your media assets.
